# kubectl api-versions

## api versions

The `kubectl api-versions` command helps a user to find out the version of resources we can use.  
We talk about how this will come in handy not just for the CKAD exam but also for day to day usage.

``` shell
k api-versions
k api-versions | grep -i auto
```
